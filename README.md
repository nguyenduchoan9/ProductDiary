# Transaction Viewer

Your manager has asked you to design and implement a mobile app to help the firm
executives who are always flying around the globe. They need a list of every
product the company trades with, and the sales of those products, which are made
in different currencies.

Your application should be composed of two screens:

* [ok]  In the first one, your application should
  * [ok]  give the users the choice of which product they want to see, and
  * [ok]  show the count of transactions for that product.
* [ok]  When the user selects a product, the application must show
  * [ok]  each of the transactions related to that product,
  * [ok]  the amount of each transaction converted to GBP and
  * [ok]  the sum of all of these transactions in GBP.
  
In a real environment, you will probably download all the data you need from the
Internet. To simplify this task, so you donâ€™t need to worry about network
management, your application should be designed to be able to work with two
JSON files:

  transactions.json : holds an array of dictionaries where each one represents
  a transaction related to a product, indicated by its stock keeping unit (SKU),
  with a given currency and amount.
  rates.json : specifies the conversion rate from one currency to another.
